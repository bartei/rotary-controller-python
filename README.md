[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1386014070632878100?style=social)](https://discord.gg/EDtgj7Yayr) [![Shop at Provvedo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Shop-Provvedo-blue?logo=shopify&style=flat-square)](https://www.provvedo.com/shop)

A **Kivy-based Digital Read-Out (DRO) and single-axis controller UI** for rotary tables and similar devices, designed to run on Raspberry Pi or desktop environments (Windows, macOS, Linux). Interfaces via RS-485 with a dedicated STM32-based control board.

üõí **Purchase all boards from our shop:** [Provvedo Shop](https://www.provvedo.com/shop)

## üöÄ Features

* Responsive touch-capable UI built with **Kivy**
* Communicates over **RS-485** with an STM32 controller for stepper/encoder control ([github.com][1])
* Works on Raspberry Pi 3/4, Windows, macOS, and Linux
* Runs headless on Pi using the custom **OSPI** OS with pre-installed RCP ([github.com][1])

---

## üéØ Requirements

* **Hardware**

  * Rotary controller board (STM32 firmware from `bartei/rotary-controller-f4`)
  * RS-485 interface (e.g. via Power Hat)
  * Raspberry Pi 3/4 for Pi deployments

* **Software**

  * Python 3.8+
  * `uv` virtual environment manager
  * `kivy`, `pyserial`, and other dependencies from `pyproject.toml`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bartei/rotary-controller-python.git
cd rotary-controller-python
```

### 2. Install `uv`

Install `uv` (Linux/macOS):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

For Windows, follow instructions on the \[Astral uv docs].

### 3. Create & Sync Virtual Environment

```bash
uv venv       # creates .venv/
uv sync       # installs required dependencies
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
uv run python ./rcp/main.py
```

---

## üíª Platform-specific Notes

### Windows/macOS/Linux

* Use Python >=3.8
* Virtual environment recommended via `uv`
* Ensure `pyserial` can access your RS-485 adapter (permissions on Linux/macOS)

### Raspberry Pi & OSPI

* Install an SD card image from the [OSPI project](https://github.com/bartei/ospi)
* RCP is pre-installed in `/root/rotary-controller-python/`
* To update:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl stop rotary-controller
  cd /root/rotary-controller-python
  git pull
  uv sync
  reboot
  ```
* View logs:

  ```bash
  journalctl -u rotary-controller
  journalctl -xeu rotary-controller
  tail -n +1 /var/log/kivy*
  ```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

* **Serial issues**: Verify RS-485 wiring, correct serial port, and permissions
* **Service failures (Pi)**: Check `journalctl` logs and Kivy log files, check the /var/log folder for OSPI release
